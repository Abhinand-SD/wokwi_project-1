IBM IoT Internship Project: Motion and Temperature Monitoring System
Project Name: Motion and Temperature Monitoring System
Platform: Wokwi (Arduino Simulator)
Technologies Used: Arduino (C++), PIR Motion Sensor, Temperature Sensor (LM35), LED, Buzzer

Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my IBM IoT Internship. It is a simple motion and temperature monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system continuously monitors motion using a PIR sensor and detects temperature using a temperature sensor (LM35 or similar).

Features
Motion Detection:

Uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement.
If motion is detected, the LED and buzzer turn ON to alert the user.
If no motion is detected, the LED and buzzer remain OFF.
Temperature Monitoring:

Reads temperature using an analog temperature sensor.
Converts the raw analog value into Celsius and prints the temperature to the Serial Monitor.
How It Works
The motion sensor detects movement and triggers an alert (LED & buzzer).
The temperature sensor reads and displays the surrounding temperature.
The data is displayed via serial communication for monitoring purposes.
Applications
Home security systems (motion detection for intruder alerts).
Temperature monitoring in smart homes or industries.
IoT-based monitoring solutions for real-time data tracking.
GitHub Repository
The full project, including the code and simulation files, has been uploaded to GitHub.
